# cXCMS

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of cXCMS is to provide the framework for efficient high performance computing (HPC) untargeted LCMS data pre-processing. Also, the package memory optimizes the workflow in desktop environments (MacOS or Windows), allowing preprocessing of larger sample sizes. 

### Installation

You can install the development version of cXCMS from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("johanLassen/cXMS")
```

### Overview

The cluster xcms package is dependent on the regular xcms package. We aim to make as few changes as possible to ease the use and maintenance of the package.

```{r example, warning=F, error=F, message=F}
library(cXCMS)
library(xcms)
```

Here's the idea behind the package: The workflow makes the peak picking and the peak integration parallel to (1) reduce memory consumption and (2) improve support for multi-node high performance cluster processing. The first achievement benefits all workflows by lowering memory requirements, while the second achievement allows parallelization. All of the processes are orchestrated by a simple metadata data frame that we will describe below.
